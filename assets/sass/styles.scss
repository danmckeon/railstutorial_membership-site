//This contains all of the "core" styles used in the site. These are general styles that are used throughout but aren't 
//function specifc (think things like body colors or default font sizes). Each individual page and or functionality should 
//have it's own .scss file with a naming convention of *page name*.scss. 

//Page styles should focus on the styling of the unique page content only and then be imported into this file in the import 
//section below. Additionally any global style variables (e.g. colors used in the color pallet) should be defined in this file 
//as well and nowhere else.
